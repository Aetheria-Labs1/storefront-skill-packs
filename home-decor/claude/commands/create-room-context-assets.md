## Loaded Knowledge

### home-expertise

# Home & Lifestyle — Storefront Design Intelligence
> **When to load:** Furniture, home decor, candles, textiles, bedding, kitchenware, outdoor living, rugs, lighting, wall art, planters, storage, tableware.
## Philosophy
**Context is everything.** Home goods buyers need to see the product in a real space before they can imagine it in their own. A dining table photographed in isolation tells you nothing about scale, proportion, or how it anchors a room. The same table in a styled dining room, with chairs, a rug, lighting, and place settings, becomes tangible — the buyer can measure it against their own space and see the lifestyle it enables.
## Section Sequences
### Furniture PDP (10-12 sections)
1. **Room Scene Hero** — product in fully styled room, focal point
2. **Quick Specs** — dimensions, materials, weight, assembly (above fold)
3. **Product Gallery** — room context + detail shots + scale reference
4. **Dimensions Deep Dive** — Tabs island (Dimensions | Materials | Care | Shipping)
5. **Material Story** — bento grid with material origin, craftsmanship, finish
6. **Room Inspiration Gallery** — asymmetric grid showing 4-6 different room settings
7. **Cross-Sell ("Complete the Room")** — ProductCarousel with related items
8. **Before/After Testimonials** — BeforeAfter island with room makeovers
9. **Photo Reviews** — ReviewCarousel with customer room photos
10. **FAQ** — assembly, shipping, returns (FAQ island)
11. **Design Philosophy** — brand story, values, sustainability
12. **Footer CTA** — EmailCapture for design tips
## Island Combinations
### Furniture PDP
```html
<!-- ProductGallery: room context + detail + scale -->
<div data-island="ProductGallery" data-props='{
  "images": [
    {"src": "room-wide.jpg", "alt": "Dining table in styled room", "type": "room"},
    {"src": "detail-leg.jpg", "alt": "Close-up of oak leg joinery", "type": "detail"},
    {"src": "scale-room.jpg", "alt": "Table with person seated", "type": "scale"},
    {"src": "room-angle2.jpg", "alt": "Dining room from kitchen view", "type": "room"}
  ],
  "thumbnailPosition": "left"
}'></div>
## Typography & Color
### Typography
- **Headings:** Warm serif (Fraunces, Quincy CF, Canela) or geometric sans (Avenir Next, Graphik, Suisse Intl) at 400-500 weight
- **Body:** 15-17px, 1.6-1.7 line-height, never below 14px
- **Eyebrow:** 11-12px uppercase, 0.12em letter-spacing, muted color
- **Hierarchy:** Large product name (3-4rem), subdued descriptors (0.875rem), generous whitespace
## Hero Patterns
### Room Scene Hero (Furniture)
```html
<section class="relative min-h-[85vh]" id="hero">
  <img 
    src="ASSET[dining-room-wide-hero.jpg]" 
    alt="The Everyday Table in a sunlit dining room with oak chairs and linen curtains" 
    class="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover"
    loading="eager"
  />
  <!-- Gradient overlay for text legibility -->
  <div class="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-r from-white/80 via-white/40 to-transparent"></div>
## Dimensions Section (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**For furniture, dimensions MUST be in the first 2-3 sections.** Use the Tabs island with Dimensions as the default open tab.
## Material Story Section
**The "why it costs what it costs" section.** Bento-style grid with material origin, craftsmanship, finish, and durability. Pair with ImageZoom for tactile close-ups.
## Room Inspiration Gallery
**Asymmetric CSS Grid showing the product in 4-6 different room settings.** Critical for buyers who need to see versatility.
## Social Proof
**Photo reviews showing the product in REAL customer homes** (not staged). This is the most trusted content in the home vertical — buyers want to see the product after delivery, in imperfect lighting, in real rooms.
## Photography
**Room context is non-negotiable.** Do not show furniture floating in a white void — it reads as cheap, despite the price point.
## Anti-Patterns
### 12 Home Page Killers
## Complete Blueprint Example
**Full VibePage JSON for Furniture PDP (Dining Table)**
## Summary
Home & lifestyle pages succeed when they **transport the buyer into the space** — not just show them a product. Every section should answer: "What will this look like in my home? How will it feel? Will it fit? Is it worth the price?" Context, scale, material story, and real customer rooms are the four pillars. Skip any of them and conversions collapse.

### design-enrichment

# Design Enrichment — AI Image Generation & Compositing
How to use `generate_asset`, `edit_asset`, and `view_asset` tools to create custom images for page sections. Load when a page needs custom imagery beyond what's in the design library.
## Decision Tree: Generate vs Reuse
```
Need an image for a section?
│
├─ search_design_library({ query: "hero lifestyle skincare" })
│  ├─ Found good match → USE IT (free, brand-consistent)
│  └─ No match or poor quality → GENERATE
│
├─ Product shot needed?
│  ├─ list_products() has product images → USE EXISTING
│  └─ Need product-on-background composite → edit_asset()
│
└─ Custom background/texture/lifestyle → generate_asset()
```
## Pipeline: Generate → Verify → Use
### Step 1: Generate Image (write your own descriptive prompt)
## Style Selection Guide
| Brand Tone | `style` param | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Luxury/Premium | `photography` or `editorial` | High-end studio quality, dramatic lighting |
| Playful/Bold | `illustration` or `3d_render` | Vibrant, stylized, fun |
| Clinical/Minimal | `photography` | Clean, white backgrounds, precise |
| Earthy/Organic | `photography` or `lifestyle` | Natural light, textures, warmth |
| Tech/Modern | `3d_render` or `abstract` | Geometric, gradients, futuristic |
| Fashion | `editorial` | Editorial spreads, high contrast |
## Purpose Mapping
| Section Type | `purpose` param | `aspect` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hero full-width | `hero_bg` | `landscape` | Wide, dramatic |
| Hero split (image half) | `product_lifestyle` | `portrait` or `square` | Product in context |
| Section background | `section_bg` | `landscape` | Subtle, not distracting |
| Product on background | `product_composite` | `square` | Use edit_asset |
| Card/feature image | `card_bg` | `square` | Small, tight crop |
| Texture/pattern | `texture_fill` | `square` | Tileable, subtle |
| Floating decoration | `decorative_element` | `square` | Transparent PNG |
| Flat lay composition | `product_lifestyle` | `landscape` | Multiple items arranged |
## Compositing with edit_asset
### Product on Lifestyle Background
## Placing Images in HTML
### Hero Background
## Cost Control
| Quality | Cost | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `low` | Cheap | Textures, patterns, decorative elements |
| `medium` | Moderate | Card images, section backgrounds, secondary visuals |
| `high` | Expensive | Hero images, primary product shots, key visuals |
## Common Prompt Patterns
### Hero Backgrounds
- "Soft gradient background with subtle botanical shadows, [brand_color] tones, editorial feel"
- "Abstract geometric shapes with smooth gradient, modern minimal, [brand_colors]"
- "Lifestyle flat lay with [product_category] items, overhead shot, clean styling"
## Anti-Patterns
1. **Don't generate when library has it** — waste of cost and time
2. **Don't use `url()` in section CSS** — blocked by validator. Use `<img>` or inline `style` attribute
3. **Don't generate product shots** — always use real product images from `list_products`
4. **Don't over-generate** — 2-4 assets per page max. Use CSS gradients/colors for the rest
5. **Don't use `quality: "high"` for everything** — reserve for hero/primary images only
6. **Don't forget alt text** — decorative images get `alt="" aria-hidden="true"`, meaningful ones get descriptive alt

## Workflow

# Design Assets & Brand Management

Manage visual assets (search, generate, edit) and brand identity (kit, themes).

## Asset Pipeline (Priority Order)

Always follow this order — never generate when existing assets work:

### 1. Search First
```
search_design_library({ query: "lifestyle woman skincare" })
```
Returns existing brand assets (product shots, lifestyle, textures, SVGs).

### 2. Generate If Needed
```
generate_asset({
  prompt: "Minimalist skincare flatlay on marble surface, soft morning light",
  style: "photography",        // photography | illustration | 3d_render | editorial | abstract
  purpose: "hero_bg",          // hero_bg | product_lifestyle | card_bg | section_bg | icon | texture
  aspect: "landscape",         // landscape | portrait | square
  quality: "medium",           // low | medium | high
  brand_colors: ["#1a1a1a", "#f5f5dc"]
})
```

### 3. Edit/Composite
```
edit_asset({
  source_ids: ["asset_123", "asset_456"],
  prompt: "Place product bottle on the lifestyle background, natural lighting match",
  mode: "composite"            // composite | inpaint | style_transfer
})
```

### 4. Verify
```
view_asset(asset_id)
```
Visual verification before using in page.

## Style Selection Guide

| Brand Tone | Style |
|-----------|-------|
| Luxury/Premium | `photography` or `editorial` |
| Playful/Fun | `illustration` or `3d_render` |
| Tech/Modern | `abstract` or `3d_render` |
| Natural/Organic | `photography` |
| Artistic/Creative | `editorial` or `illustration` |

## Purpose → Aspect Ratio

| Purpose | Aspect | Typical Use |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| hero_bg | landscape | Full-width hero backgrounds |
| product_lifestyle | portrait/square | Product in context |
| card_bg | square | Grid cards, thumbnails |
| section_bg | landscape | Section backgrounds |
| icon | square | Small decorative elements |
| texture | square | Repeating patterns, overlays |

## Brand Kit Management

### Read Brand Identity
```
get_brand_kit()
```
Returns: logo, fonts (heading/body), colors (primary/secondary/accent), border radius, spacing scale, brand voice.

### List Available Themes
```
list_themes()
```
Returns: theme IDs, names, which is default.

### Update Theme
```
update_theme(theme_id, {
  fonts: { heading: "Inter", body: "Inter" },
  colors: { primary: "#000", accent: "#ff6b00" },
  border_radius: "8px"
})
```

## Design References

### Extract from URL
```
extract_brand_design({ url: "https://brand.com" })
```
Returns: palette, fonts, spacing, tone analysis.

## Cost Control

- `low` quality: fast, cheap — use for textures, backgrounds, placeholders
- `medium` quality: default — use for most section images
- `high` quality: expensive — use only for hero images and key product shots
- Budget: ~3-5 generated assets per page maximum
- Always `search_design_library` first to avoid unnecessary generation
