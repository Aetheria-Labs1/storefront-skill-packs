Analyze and optimize an existing landing page for better conversions

## Prerequisites

Connect the Lexsis AI MCP server:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lexsis-ai": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.trylexsis.com/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer <your-api-key>" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Loaded Knowledge

### conversion-psychology

# Conversion Psychology — Storefront Design Intelligence
> When to load: ALWAYS. Read before generating any ecommerce page.
## The Conversion Stack (AIDA → Sections)
Map the AIDA framework to section order. Each stage requires specific psychology and placement.
## Above-the-Fold Rules
What MUST be visible without scroll (< 900px viewport height). Violating this kills 40%+ of conversions.
## Price Psychology Patterns
### Anchoring (strikethrough + current)
## Social Proof Hierarchy
Rank order by persuasive power (highest to lowest). Use this sequence in sections.
## Urgency & Scarcity
Three types. Each requires different implementation and psychology.
## Cognitive Load Management
Max 3 choices per section. More options = decision paralysis = abandonment.
## Trust Escalation Ladder
Move visitors from low-commitment → high-commitment actions. Don't ask for the sale immediately.
## CTA Psychology
Button copy is conversion science. Every word matters.
## Visual Hierarchy for Conversion
Eye-flow patterns direct attention to CTAs.
## Anti-Patterns (Conversion Killers)
| ❌ | Why | ✅ |
|----|-----|-----|
| Generic headlines ("Welcome to Our Store") | No hook, no benefit | "Get [Specific Benefit] in [Timeframe]" |
| Hidden prices ("Contact for Pricing") | Friction, distrust | Show price upfront (even if high) |
| Walls of text (5-paragraph descriptions) | Cognitive overload | Bullet points, max 3 benefits |
| Too many CTAs (3+ above fold) | Decision paralysis | 1 primary CTA, 1 optional secondary |
| Tiny mobile buttons (40px tap target) | Poor UX, missed clicks | 48px minimum (py-3 or py-4) |
| Auto-playing video with sound | Annoys users | Muted autoplay, click to unmute |
| No trust signals above fold | Credibility gap | Add star rating or customer count near CTA |
| Fake urgency (evergreen countdown) | Trust erosion | Real sale end dates or remove timer |
| Cluttered forms (8-field email capture) | Abandonment | Email only with `data-island="EmailCapture"` |
| Slow load times (5+ second hero load) | Bounce rate spike | Optimize images, lazy-load below fold |
| No mobile optimization (desktop-only) | Poor mobile UX | Responsive spacing, clamp() font sizes |
| Unclear value prop ("We're the best") | Generic, meaningless | "Save 10 hours/week with automated [task]" |
| No risk reversal (no guarantee) | Fear of loss | Risk reversal section before final CTA |
| Dead-end pages (no next step) | Lost momentum | Every section ends with CTA or link |
| Inconsistent branding (5 button styles) | Unprofessional | Consistent colors via CSS vars |

## Workflow

# Storefront Page Editing

Edit existing pages using section-level operations.

## Edit Flow

1. `list_pages` — find target page
2. `get_page` — read current page structure + HTML
3. Make changes (one of the operations below)
4. `validate_vibe_page` — verify changes are valid
5. Page auto-versions on each mutation

## Operations

### Update/Replace a Section

```
update_page_section(page_id, section_id, { html, css, settings })
```
- Can replace HTML entirely or patch specific parts
- Auto-bumps page version
- Use for: changing copy, swapping images, restyling

### Add a New Section

```
update_page_section(page_id, null, { html, css, settings, position })
```
- Position: "before:{section_id}" or "after:{section_id}" or index number
- Must include full section HTML

### Remove a Section

```
remove_page_section(page_id, section_id)
```
- Irreversible — confirm with user first
- Auto-bumps version

### Reorder Sections

```
move_page_section(page_id, section_id, new_position)
```
- Position is 0-indexed
- All other sections shift accordingly

## Best Practices

- Always `get_page` first to understand current structure
- Reference section IDs from the page data (don't guess)
- After editing, run `validate_vibe_page` before telling user it's done
- For multi-section changes, batch them (each call bumps version)
- Preserve existing CSS variables and island configurations
- Don't break mobile responsiveness when editing desktop layout


# Storefront Analytics & Experiments

Access page performance data and manage A/B experiments.

## Analytics Tools

### Page-Level Deep Dive
```
get_page_analytics(page_id)
```
Returns: CVR, bounce rate, time on page, traffic sources, device split, top-performing sections.

### Time Series Trends
```
get_analytics_timeseries({ metric: "conversions", period: "daily", range: "30d" })
```
Returns: daily/weekly trends for hits, conversions, revenue, AOV.

### Revenue Attribution
```
get_attribution({ page_id? })
```
Returns: ROAS by channel, revenue per page, top campaigns driving conversions.

## A/B Testing Flow

### 1. Create Experiment
```
create_ab_test({
  page_id: "...",
  variants: [{ blueprint_id: "...", weight: 50 }, { blueprint_id: "...", weight: 50 }]
})
```

### 2. Monitor Results
```
get_experiment_results(experiment_id)
```
Returns: CVR per variant, statistical significance (mSPRT), sample sizes, winner recommendation.

### 3. Scale Winner
```
scale_winner(experiment_id, { variant_id: "..." })
```
Scales winning variant to 100% traffic, marks experiment complete.

## Best Practices

- Wait for statistical significance before scaling winner
- Minimum ~1000 visitors per variant for reliable results
- Check device split — a variant may win on mobile but lose on desktop
- Use `get_attribution` to understand which traffic sources convert best
- Compare page analytics before/after changes to measure impact
