## Generation Flow (Overview)
```
1. get_storefront_skills({ brief, page_type }) → system prompt, island catalog, schema
2. [Optional] search_design_library() → find existing brand assets
3. [Optional] generate_asset(prompt, style, purpose) → get image URLs
4. Agent generates VibePage JSON (HTML+Tailwind per section)
5. validate_vibe_page({ page }) → structural + security check
6. write_vibe_page({ slug, page }) → persist to renderer
7. preview_vibe_page({ slug }) → get preview URL
```
## CSS Variables (Brand Theming)
All sections use these CSS custom properties (set in `theme_css`):
## Quality Bar
**Great page:**
- Mobile-first (works at 375px, enhances at lg:)
- Uses CSS vars for all brand colors/fonts (no hardcoded hex)
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Islands for all interactive commerce (BuyBox, Cart, Reviews)
- Generated/library images — no broken placeholder URLs in production
- Smooth scroll reveal on key sections
- Trust signals near purchase points
- Sticky add-to-cart on PDP
## Anti-Patterns (NEVER do these)
1. **No `fetch()` or XHR in section JS** — blocked by hydrator security
2. **No `eval()`, `localStorage`, `WebSocket`** — blocked
3. **No `@import` in section CSS** — blocked
4. **No external `url()` in CSS** — only inline gradients/colors
5. **No duplicate section IDs** — each must be unique kebab-case
6. **No `<script src="...">` in HTML** — use section `js` field for vanilla JS
7. **No framework code** — no React/Vue/Angular in section HTML (islands handle interactivity)
8. **Don't fake commerce** — always use BuyBox island for add-to-cart, never a plain button
## Section ID Naming
Use descriptive kebab-case: `hero`, `product-gallery`, `social-proof`, `ingredients`, `faq`, `sticky-cta`, `trust-badges`, `footer`. Never `section-1`, `section-2`.
## Island Rules
- `data-props` must be valid JSON in single-quoted attribute
- Only use valid island names (26 total — call `get_island_catalog` to see them)
- One `BuyBox` per page (multiple breaks cart state)
- One `CartDrawer` per page
- `StickyBar` needs `triggerOffset` — distance in px before it appears
- `ReviewCarousel` can use custom reviews array OR fetch from Shopify via productId
## Tailwind Usage
- CDN included in renderer — all utility classes available
- Use responsive prefixes: `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`
- Prefer utilities over custom CSS (only use section `css` for keyframes/animations)
- Use `clamp()` for fluid typography: `text-[clamp(2rem,5vw,4rem)]`
- Container: `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8`
## Image Strategy
1. **Always check `search_design_library` first** — brand's uploaded assets are free and on-brand
2. **Use `list_products` for product images** — never generate fake product shots
3. **`generate_asset` for custom imagery** — hero backgrounds, lifestyle contexts, textures
4. **`edit_asset` for composites** — product-on-background, texture overlays
5. **Place URLs directly in HTML** — `<img src="${url}" />` or inline `style="background-image: url(...)"`
6. **Load `design-enrichment` skill** for full asset generation pipeline details

### conversion-psychology

# Conversion Psychology — Storefront Design Intelligence
> When to load: ALWAYS. Read before generating any ecommerce page.
## The Conversion Stack (AIDA → Sections)
Map the AIDA framework to section order. Each stage requires specific psychology and placement.
## Above-the-Fold Rules
What MUST be visible without scroll (< 900px viewport height). Violating this kills 40%+ of conversions.
## Price Psychology Patterns
### Anchoring (strikethrough + current)
## Social Proof Hierarchy
Rank order by persuasive power (highest to lowest). Use this sequence in sections.
## Urgency & Scarcity
Three types. Each requires different implementation and psychology.
## Cognitive Load Management
Max 3 choices per section. More options = decision paralysis = abandonment.
## Trust Escalation Ladder
Move visitors from low-commitment → high-commitment actions. Don't ask for the sale immediately.
## CTA Psychology
Button copy is conversion science. Every word matters.
## Visual Hierarchy for Conversion
Eye-flow patterns direct attention to CTAs.
## Anti-Patterns (Conversion Killers)
| ❌ | Why | ✅ |
|----|-----|-----|
| Generic headlines ("Welcome to Our Store") | No hook, no benefit | "Get [Specific Benefit] in [Timeframe]" |
| Hidden prices ("Contact for Pricing") | Friction, distrust | Show price upfront (even if high) |
| Walls of text (5-paragraph descriptions) | Cognitive overload | Bullet points, max 3 benefits |
| Too many CTAs (3+ above fold) | Decision paralysis | 1 primary CTA, 1 optional secondary |
| Tiny mobile buttons (40px tap target) | Poor UX, missed clicks | 48px minimum (py-3 or py-4) |
| Auto-playing video with sound | Annoys users | Muted autoplay, click to unmute |
| No trust signals above fold | Credibility gap | Add star rating or customer count near CTA |
| Fake urgency (evergreen countdown) | Trust erosion | Real sale end dates or remove timer |
| Cluttered forms (8-field email capture) | Abandonment | Email only with `data-island="EmailCapture"` |
| Slow load times (5+ second hero load) | Bounce rate spike | Optimize images, lazy-load below fold |
| No mobile optimization (desktop-only) | Poor mobile UX | Responsive spacing, clamp() font sizes |
| Unclear value prop ("We're the best") | Generic, meaningless | "Save 10 hours/week with automated [task]" |
| No risk reversal (no guarantee) | Fear of loss | Risk reversal section before final CTA |
| Dead-end pages (no next step) | Lost momentum | Every section ends with CTA or link |
| Inconsistent branding (5 button styles) | Unprofessional | Consistent colors via CSS vars |
## Complete Page Recipes
### Recipe 1: Lead Gen (Email Capture)

## Workflow

# Ad Creative to Landing Page

Generate a high-converting landing page from an ad creative with full scent continuity (headline, palette, CTA, tone match from click to page).

## Prerequisites

- At least one ad creative synced (Meta/Google/TikTok)
- Store connected and brand kit configured

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Context Gathering

```
get_workspace_details()          → workspace ID, plan tier
get_connected_stores()           → store domain, Shopify data
get_brand_kit()                  → logo, fonts, colors, voice, radius
```

These three calls ALWAYS run first. No exceptions.

### Step 2 — Identify and Analyze the Ad

```
get_ad_creatives({ store_id, status: "active" })
```

Present available creatives (thumbnail + headline + spend). User picks one, or use highest-spend active creative.

```
analyze_ad_creative({ creative_id })
```

Extracts: headline, subheadline, claims, color_palette, tone, cta_text, target_audience, urgency_signals, imagery_style.

### Step 3 — Match Persona and Source Assets

```
match_persona_to_ad({ creative_id })
```

Maps to persona: demographics, pain points, motivations, objections, buying stage. Determines page tone.

```
search_design_library({ query: "<product/topic from ad>" })
```

Find product shots and lifestyle images matching the ad aesthetic. Use `generate_asset` if library insufficient.

### Step 4 — Two-Phase Page Generation

**Phase A — Raw HTML + Tailwind (no islands)**

Generate full page as HTML + Tailwind. Scent continuity rules:
- Hero headline = ad headline (semantic match, max 2-word variation)
- `--lx-accent-color` set to ad's dominant color
- CTA text matches or escalates the ad CTA
- First fold answers the same promise the ad made
- Zero navigation links (single CTA focus)

Structure: Hero > Problem/Agitation > Solution > Social Proof > Features > CTA repeat > FAQ

Mark interactive placeholders: `<div data-placeholder="BuyBox" class="..."></div>`

Use `--lx-*` CSS variables in `theme_css` for all brand colors and fonts.

**Phase B — Island Mapping**

Replace placeholders with hydrated islands:
```html
<div data-island="BuyBox" data-props='{"product":{"title":"...","price":"$29.99","variants":[...]}}'></div>
```

Use `get_island_schema` for exact prop shapes.

### Step 5 — Validate and Publish Draft

```
validate_vibe_page(page_data)
publish_vibe_page(page_data, { publish: false })
```

Always publish as draft first. Returns `preview_url`.

### Step 6 — Visual Verification

**Claude Code (Playwright MCP):**
```
browser_navigate({ url: preview_url })
browser_take_screenshot()
```

**Codex:** Use built-in browser to open preview_url.

**Other IDEs:** Provide URL: "Preview: {url} -- open to verify."

Checklist:
- [ ] Hero headline matches ad headline (scent continuity)
- [ ] Brand colors applied via `--lx-*` variables (not defaults)
- [ ] Single CTA focus (no nav leakage)
- [ ] Mobile layout not broken (stack, readable text)
- [ ] Islands hydrated (BuyBox shows product data)
- [ ] Social proof section present

If issues found: `update_page_section` to fix, then re-verify.

## Decision Points

| Question | Decision |
|----------|----------|
| Which ad? | Ask user, or highest-spend active creative |
| Which product? | Extract from ad analysis (primary product) |
| Draft or live? | Always draft first -- user confirms |
| Long or short? | Video ad = longer storytelling; static = concise |
| Include pricing? | Only if ad mentions price/discount explicitly |

## Quality Gates

- Hero headline >=80% semantic similarity to ad headline
- Color palette matches ad dominant colors (set via `--lx-accent-color`)
- Single primary CTA throughout (no competing actions)
- Mobile-first layout (most ad traffic is mobile)
- No navigation links that leak traffic from conversion
- Ad urgency signals carried through (countdown, limited stock, etc.)
- Page passes `validate_vibe_page` with zero errors
